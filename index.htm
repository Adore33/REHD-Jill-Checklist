<li data-id="playthrough_0_1" class="f_other">Dining Room.  When you gain control of <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Jill_Valentine">Jill Valentine</a>, head west to meet up with <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Barry_Burton">Barry Burton</a>. After the cutscene, turn around and use the nearby door.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_2" class="f_other">Piano Room Hallway.  Head west down the hallway. After the cutscene, turn around, head east down the hallway and use the first door on your right.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_3" class="f_other">Dining Room.  After the cutscene, head east and use the double doors at the end.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_4" class="f_other">Main Hall.  After the cutscene, head up the stairs, then turn around and head back down again. After the cutscene, head west and use the double doors.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_5" class="f_item">Head into the hall and you'll find <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Kenneth_J._Sullivan">Kenneth J. Sullivan's</a> corpse. Search him and collect <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Kenneth%27s_Film">Kenneth's Film</a>. This film can be watched later in the game.  It is considered a file and not an item.  Move past <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Kenneth_J._Sullivan">Kenneth J. Sullivan</a> and through the door. You'll find yourself in a hall. The table with the bird cage has <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazine</a>. Also collect the two <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a>.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_6" class="f_item">Head upstairs and through the door. You'll see a corpse immediately in front of you. Ignore it for now. Instead, head toward the mirror and stand right next to it, facing the camera. See the zombie in the mirror? He's waiting to ambush you just off the frame. Raise your gun and shoot until he drops once. Then rush past and up the hall. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Arrow">Golden Arrow</a> and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazine</a>. Be wary of a second zombie hiding just off frame to your left.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_7" class="f_other">If you're careful, you can lure him into a lunge then rush past his shoulder, dodging his second grab. This technique is a great ammo-saving method, and is recommended throughout your adventure.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_8" class="f_item">Once past him, head to the right-hand door. You'll be on a balcony. There's a zombie at the far end of the balcony. You can safely evade him, but don't forget he hangs around up here. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a> nearby. On the far end of the balcony is a statue holding a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Gemstone">Blue Gemstone</a>. Push it to the open rail and then off the balcony's edge so it breaks on the floor below you. Don't worry about heading back down for it just yet.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_9" class="f_item">Head through the double doors to the main lobby. Headup the short flight of stairs and when the camera angle changes, head through the door infront of you to access the graveyard. Dodge the zombie here and head toward the tomb with the archer statue. Examine your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Arrow">Golden Arrow</a> and it will become an <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Arrowhead">Arrowhead</a>. Use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Arrowhead">Arrowhead</a> and you'll gain access to the Crypt. Head into the Crypt and follow the camera to the back and take the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Book_of_Curses">Book Of Curses</a> off the stand. Flip it over and examine it and you'll get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Key">Sword Key</a>.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_10" class="f_other">Return to the Main Hall, on the east side of this room (opposite door from the dining room) there are double doors, proceed through them.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_11" class="f_other"><font color="red" style="font-family:Georgia;">WARNING</font>: Do not exit this room back to the main hall as this will cause <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Barry_Burton">Barry Burton</a> to hand you <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Acid_Shells">Acid Shells</a>, making the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> inaccessible later on in this guide.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_12" class="f_item">You will notice that there is a flashing item in the statue, it is the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Map_of_1ST_FLOOR">Map Of The 1F</a>. To get the map, you will have to climb over the dresser on the opposite side to push it  forward once so you can move it to the statue. Be careful not to go too far into the room on the left as there is a zombie awaiting to ambush you. If you manage to get the dresser stuck, do not exit back to the hall but instead open the door on the right and head back to reset its location.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_13" class="f_item">After you obtained the map, proceed through the right-hand side door. Head into the hall and push the first dresser to find a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a>. Don't be alarmed by the ambient jump scare.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_14" class="f_item">Proceed down the hall and push the last dresser as soon as the camera angle changes to reveal <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazine</a>. Take note that the dresser in this hallway is pushed in the opposite direction from the last one.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_15" class="f_other">Continue on through the door.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_16" class="f_other"><font color="red" style="font-family:Georgia;">WARNING</font>: Entering the previous hall from the opposite direction will result in a dog ambush. If at all possible, do not go back through the door you just entered.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_17" class="f_item">Once you step into this hall take the metal door you see on the left. Outside, grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chemical">Chemical</a> and as many <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a> as you can carry, but make sure to leave one space open so you can obtain the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> shortly. Also remember you can always eat or combine <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a> to free up inventory if you need to. Return back to the hall you just came from.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_18" class="f_item">Head into the next door you can open, which leads into a bathroom. Drain the tub, and there will be a cut-scene where Jill disposes of a zombie. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a> from the bathtub and leave the room.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_19" class="f_item">Pass through the next door ahead you can enter. You'll find yourself in a very small room with another exit. Head through the other door and you'll be in a room with a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Ink_Ribbon">Ink Ribbon</a>, a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a>, and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a>. If you have enough free space, grab them; your main focus is getting that <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a>. Taking the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> will trigger an obvious trap, there's no risk of death even if this guide hasn't been followed completely so go ahead and exit this room.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_20" class="f_other">As you step back through the only exit into the tiny room, the ceiling will begin to drop. Now, very quickly check the exit back into the hall. It will be locked. Immediately check the door back to the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> room. It will also be locked.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_21" class="f_item">As long as you did not go back to the main hall and trigger the cutscene to where <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Barry_Burton">Barry Burton</a> gives you <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Acid_Shells">Acid Shells</a>, you are able to obtain the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a>. Otherwise, only one of the doors will be locked and you will have to place the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> back on the stand and obtain the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> later in the game.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_22" class="f_item">Continue down the hall to the double doors. Once through these, you'll see another door on the left side of the screen. Head through it. You'll appear near the bottom of a staircase. Before proceeding up the staircase, there will be a very annoying zombie beside a door. If you can manage it, dodge him and rush through the door. Gun him down since we will be accessing this room a few times later in the game.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_23" class="f_item">Head into the door, this is the first Save Room. Save, then Item Box your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Ink_Ribbon">Ink Ribbons</a>, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_Knife_(RE1)">Knife</a>, spare healing items, and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chemical">Chemical</a>. Since we do not have the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lighter_(RE1)">Lighter</a> yet, go ahead and keep the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Canteen">Fuel Canteen</a> deposited.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_24" class="f_other">Head back out with at least 3 empty item slots, head up the stairs and try to avoid as much zombies as possible and then head east or towards the right into backwards C shaped hallway.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_25" class="f_item">You will notice that there is a table with a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Wooden_Mount">Wooden Mount</a> on it,  get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Wooden_Mount">Wooden Mount</a> on the lamp shelf and head right, dodging the zombie in the hall, and head through the door just past him.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_26" class="f_item">You'll find yourself in a small study. Search the room and find the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dog_Whistle">Dog Whistle</a>, a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazine</a>, and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lighter_(RE1)">Lighter</a>.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_27" class="f_item">If you killed any zombies in the stairway hall, you may want to burn them now to keep them from coming back as <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Head">Crimson Heads</a>. Use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Canteen">Fuel Canteen</a> to burn them. If you do, make sure to top off your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Kerosene">Kerosene</a> in the save room downstairs.  It's important to burn the zombie you killed infront of the Save Room when you exit as well.  Head back upstairs and go to the door at the back of the hall (there is likely another zombie around the corner). Light the fireplace with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lighter_(RE1)">Lighter</a> and then place the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Wooden_Mount">Wooden Mount</a> above the fireplace to get a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Map_of_2ND_FLOOR">Map Of The 2F</a>.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_28" class="f_other">Backtrack to the dim hall where you just dodged the zombie. Dodge him again, then continue off camera. Another zombie waits past the curve of the hall, so be very careful. Run past him to the end of this dim hall and unlock the door. Make sure you have at least one open item slot before opening this door.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_29" class="f_item">When you step back into the main hall, a cut scene plays. <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Barry_Burton">Barry Burton</a> will give you 6 <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Acid_Shells">Acid Shells</a>. You don't have a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Grenade_Launcher_(RE1)">Grenade Launcher</a> yet, but you will soon enough, so these will be very handy shortly.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_30" class="f_other">Cross the balcony to the double doors on the second floor west side. You'll find yourself back on the balcony above the Dining Room. Head to the door at the far end of the balcony.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_31" class="f_other">You'll be in a narrow hall. Ignore the metal door for a second and instead head into the hall. Kill the two zombies you'll find in this area, and burn them both to prevent their return as <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Head">Crimson Heads</a>.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_32" class="f_other">Head downstairs. The nearest door to the bottom of the stairs is the Medical Supply room. There's an item box and typewriter in there.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_33" class="f_item">Step past this room for a second. Head down the hall and enter the leftmost of the two doors you'll see. Inside is a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Gun">Stun Gun</a> and a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Ink_Ribbon">Ink Ribbon</a>. There's also a now semi-useless <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Shotgun_(Resident_Evil)">Broken Shotgun</a> (grab it only if you're going for 100% items)... If you didn't follow the guide and obtain the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> earlier, you can replace the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Shotgun_(Resident_Evil)">Broken Shotgun</a> with the working <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> in the room in the East Wing. More importantly, there's a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Kerosene">Kerosene</a> tank. Top off your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Canteen">Fuel Canteen</a>. If at all possible, you want to keep the hall around the Medical Room clear of <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Head">Crimson Heads</a>. Use this <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Canteen">Fuel Canteen</a> to help do so.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_34" class="f_item"><a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> in hand, head back upstairs to the metal door in the hall above. Head outside. Back up to the far corner hugging the wall near the door, face right, and blow the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dog_Whistle">Dog Whistle</a>. You may discard it after use. Immediately switch back to direct control, count to three, and then hit your auto-aim. Your gun should come up just as the first of two dogs appear. Blast away.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_35" class="f_item">You're after a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Collar">Collar</a>, which is the key to retrieving a valuable item. If you're lucky, you'll kill the first quickly enough to grab his <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Collar">Collar</a> and run back out the door without wasting bullets on the second. There are <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a> here if you need them (or if you're going for 100% items).</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_36" class="f_item">Examine the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Collar">Collar</a> and a button will appear.

<li data-id="playthrough_0_46" class="f_item">After you've lit the room, push the shelf down on the right side, toward the camera rather than away. Not the one where you found ammo. After you push it, go into it, or it could be safer to back up into it, because there will be a zombie when the angle changes. Run out and around the table and shoot the zombie until it's dead. Go back into the little opening and grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Musical_Score">Musical Score</a>.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_0_47" class="f_other">Now leave this room, and go back through the room with <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Aiken">Richard Aiken</a>.

Press the switch, don't be scared of the bee that attacks you. Once the cutscene is finished, grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_Crest">Wind Crest</a> and exit the room. Go ahead and take the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a> here and deposit them in the nearby saveroom downstairs, then make your return to the medical supplies room where the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Serum">Serum</a> was obtained for <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Aiken">Richard Aiken</a>.

There is a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Gun">Stun Gun</a> on the table. Pick it up. Now run straight, past the windows, until you see a door in the end. Open it and go inside. Put the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chemical">Chemical</a> in the water pump and turn the handle to red.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_53" class="f_item">The water will kill the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Plant">Monster Plant</a>. Also, there are 5 <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herbs</a>. Grab them if you need any and combine them, but make sure you have space for second <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Mask</a>. The <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Mask</a> is in the back, past the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a>. Now run back out, and 2 zombies will crash through the window. Run away, because you won't be back in this room for a while. Head towards the bottom part of the "F" shaped of the room. There are two doors, one on the wall and the other door at the end. If you're feeling dangerous you can enter the room on the right, grab some <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazine</a> on the bed and read the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Keeper%27s_Diary">file</a>. A zombie will come from the closet, you can attempt to dodge him or kill him and you may grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Gun">Stun Gun</a> from the closet. Otherwise, you can simply run away and exit this room if you do not care about a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Gun">Stun Gun</a>. 
<li data-id="playthrough_0_54" class="f_item">Go ahead and proceed through the other door now and you'll be in the hall where <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Kenneth_J._Sullivan">Kenneth J.

Go back to the hall. Unlock the door at the bottom of the stairs with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Key">Sword Key</a> and discard it, but don't go through the door since there is nothing valuable down there and you'll have to fight another zombie. Go back up and go through the first door on your left. 
<li data-id="playthrough_0_55" class="f_item">Inside that room is a piano. Go around the piano and push the shelf so that you find the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Musical_Score">Moonlight Sonata Cover</a>.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_56" class="f_item">Combine it with <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Musical_Score">Musical Score</a> you found by the attic and play it on the piano. The wall will move, and you have to go in the secret passage.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_57" class="f_item">Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Emblem">Gold Emblem</a> (there's also part of <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Trevor%27s_diary">Trevor's Diary</a>), replace it with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Emblem">Wooden Emblem</a>, run back to the dining room, put the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_Emblem">Gold Emblem</a> above the fireplace.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_58" class="f_item">Now go to the grandfather clock, and move the large hand twice in either direction, so it will read six o'clock. You'll get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Key">Shield Key</a>.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_59" class="f_boss f_item">Remember the room past <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Aiken">Richard Aiken</a> (get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herbs</a> if you haven't) Go there, and watch out for a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Head">Crimson Head</a>. Walk up the steps and unlock the door and discard the key. Walk a little toward the back and the big snake, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yawn">Yawn</a>, tries to eat ya.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_60" class="f_boss f_item">Now just keep avoiding the snake, because <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Aiken">Richard Aiken</a> will come to the rescue and shoot at <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yawn">Yawn</a>. There's a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Mask</a> on the other side of the room, and there's some <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Shotgun_Shells_(RE1)">Shotgun Shells</a> here as well (Easy mode), but all you really need is the third <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Mask</a>.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_61" class="f_boss f_item">After not too long, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yawn">Yawn</a> will go down, but it's not dead.

<li data-id="playthrough_0_62" class="f_item">If you were poisoned, you have to return to the save room with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Serum">Serum</a> for <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Jill_Valentine">Jill</a>. If you weren't, head back to the first floor. Now you need to head through the double doors. In the bathroom hallway, 4 zombies will come out through the windows so watch out. Go through the double doors, across from the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Pump-action_Shotgun">Pump-action Shotgun</a> room. Now you're back in an "L" shaped hallway. After coming through the double doors, keep on going down towards the camera. There should be a zombie around the corner (also zombies from the previous room may try to break in). Kill him, and go into the door to the left that you can unlock.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_63" class="f_other">You will be in a "U" shaped hallway with pictures. There are crows in here, but don't shoot at them because they won't hurt you as long as you do the puzzle right. Change the light on the first painting so it turns orange. Now, run to the other side of the "U". Flick the lights on the first two paintings. One should turn purple and the other green. Now, go all the way to the end and there will be a woman (<a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa Trevor</a>) wearing 3 things, colored orange, purple, and green. Hit the switch.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_64" class="f_item">After you hit the switch under the woman, the wall will raise. Go outside, grab the last <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Mask</a>, and unlock the gate. Now, if you don't have them, go to the save room outside of the crow room and get to the item box. You need the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Assault_Shotgun_(RE1)">Assault Shotgun</a>, and all 4 of the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Masks</a>. And maybe a couple of health items, or just save it. Now go back and through the wall the picture opened up to. I think you'll know where this is. Anyway, head down to into the crypt where you first saw the coffin. Fastest way is through the gate next to the last <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Mask</a> you just picked up. If you forgot to grab the other <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Death_mask">Death Masks</a> before coming here, you should at least unlock the gate before re-entering the mansion. You'll appreciate the shortcut later.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_65" class="f_boss f_item">Once you're down the stairs, put all the Masks on the wall (you have to match them up), and watch the cut-scene. Shoot the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Head_Prototype_1">Crimson Head Prototype 1</a> with your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Assault_Shotgun_(RE1)">Assault Shotgun</a>. It should only take about 5 rounds. After he's dead, go and grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_%26_Metal_Object">Stone And Metal Object</a> and some <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Shotgun_Shells_(RE1)">Shotgun Shells</a>. You may put away the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Assault_Shotgun_(RE1)">Assault Shotgun</a>, you won't be needing it for a little while. Keep the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_%26_Metal_Object">Stone And Metal Object</a> handy, as well as the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_Crest">Wind Crest</a>. Now head back to the hall outside the Crow Gallery. This time, keep going straight after you come out the door and open the metal to the outside. 
<li data-id="playthrough_0_66" class="f_item">Go all the way down and place the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stone_%26_Metal_Object">Stone And Metal Object</a> in the rightful place. A dog will jump out and chase after ya, but it's easy to avoid. When you have done that, go into the door.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_67" class="f_item">You're going to be in a tool shed. There are two doors here, and you need to go through the one down the small steps. By the steps, there's a shelf that carries an <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/First_Aid_Spray">First Aid Spray</a>, and a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Gun">Stun Gun</a>.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_68" class="f_item">Watch the movie sequence, then head down the path. Make the red weather vane point West. And the blue one further down should be pointing North. Then you can go through the gate. Once you're through, avoid killing the crows, and also try to avoid them getting you. The area with the birds has two graves. When you're at the graveyard with the crows, put the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_Crest">Wind Crest</a> on the right grave. Three more <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Crest_Puzzle">Crests</a> shall appear. Take all of them and examine all 3. Turn so you see their backs. Once all three other <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Crest_Puzzle">Crests</a> have their backs inspected properly, they can be inserted into the gravestone. Now put them all on the left grave, and you get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Colt_Python">Magnum</a>. There are no items in this area. So after grabbing the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Colt_Python">Magnum</a>, go through the gate opposite of the one you entered. It'll take a minute, but keep going in the path until you reach the cabin.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_69" class="f_item">Once you're in <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Courtyard/Cabin">Lisa's Shack</a>, there should be a typewriter and a item box, and a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Square_Crank">Square Crank</a> (explore the house to find these). You'll also find a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Map_of_the_COURTYARD">Map Of The Courtyard</a> at the top of the stairs just before the room with the bed and typewriter. Be sure you get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Square_Crank">Square Crank</a> (last item in the shack), which is off a little ledge by the item box. Keep it. Dump your extra stuff (<a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Colt_Python">Magnum</a>) except your weapon, and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Square_Crank">Square Crank</a>. After you get knocked out by this <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa</a>, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Jill_Valentine">Jill</a> comes to. As soon as you have control of <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Jill_Valentine">Jill</a>, take off out of the cabin. <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa</a> will be blocking your exit. Don't bother trying to kill her because she's invincible. Just run past and try to avoid her. Once you're outside <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Courtyard/Cabin">Lisa's Shack</a>, and grab the green <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herb(s)</a> next to the step (Easy mode) and go back all the way to the tool shed, though there's a zombie you'll need to avoid along the way. He's not hard to miss, and will stand still next to a tree in the walkway until fired at.
<li data-id="playthrough_0_70" class="f_item">Now go through that other door in the shed. Proceed forward for a quick cutscene. There are 3 dogs out here so kill them all. There's a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Herb">Blue Herb</a> and a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herb</a> here, so use it if you're wounded. Go up the small stairs and go through the gate. Use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Square_Crank">Square Crank</a> to lower the water and go down the ladder, run across, and go up the other ladder. Keep going and take the elevator down. Once you go down the elevator, you'll be in another part of the garden with some crows. Just run from them, but grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herb</a> along the way (Very Easy). Go to the other side of the waterfall and through the gate. There will be a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Herb">Red Herb</a> near. Watch out for the snakes. You should be able to run right past them, but if they bite you, you could get poisoned. Immediately go through the door at the end of the path.

<li data-id="playthrough_1_3" class="f_item">There are several things you need to take note of. There are two <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herbs</a>. Grab them, and there are three different colored lanterns (lantern-type) in the room. Pay attention to them.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_4" class="f_other">The colors are green, red, and orange. When you light up the lantern, you should write down the color and the number of ticks on the eyeball. For example, orange could have zero ticks, green may have four ticks, and red might have two ticks.</li>

<li data-id="playthrough_1_12" class="f_item">Do what you want to it. Waste it. Get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Control_Room_Key">Control Room Key</a> in the bathtub after you drain it.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_13" class="f_other">If you heard a loud crash while you're in here, it means the guy who hanged himself fell and is now a zombie. Don't bother with it, because it won't be in your way, and head back to room 002. If you didn't kill the zombie before, it'll still be here.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_14" class="f_item">There are two shelves in the back of this room. Push the shelf on the left back all the way. Then, go push the right shelf to the right until you can see the ladder. Now go down it, and don't worry because there are no enemies. Go down the corridors and push the boxes into the water. If you mess up, go up the ladder and come back down. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herb</a>, and go into the flooded double doors.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_15" class="f_other">You're now in the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Aqua_Ring">Aqua Ring</a>. Follow the wall towards the camera until you see a cut-scene. After that, run like hell. Keep running until you go up a few stairs.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_16" class="f_item">Use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Control_Room_Key">Control Room Key</a> to open the door and discard it. Climb down the ladder. Walk straight after <a href="">Jill</a> climbs down. Go to her left and grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/First_Aid_Box">First Aid Kit</a>. Now go back until the camera angle changes so you can see the ladder. Go to the left of the ladder, and you should see a whiteboard. Just above it (on the wall) is the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Map_of_the_AQUA_RING">Map Of The Aqua Ring</a>. Grab it, then look at the whiteboard. It will say what valve you'll need to push in a few moments.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_17" class="f_other">Now, go to the ladder's right (panel in front of the glass) and try to un-flood <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Aqua_Ring">Aqua Ring</a>. There will be a short cut-scene. After it go to the right and keeping pressing "A" (or X if you're on PS4) until you hit the switch. Now go behind the ladder and find that switch and press it. The shutter will get stuck. Go to the valves and turn the one it mentioned on the whiteboard. Now, go back and press the switch that you first pressed after the cut-scene. Now go back and hit the switch to make the shutters come down (the one behind the ladder). Finally, hit the very first switch you hit to drain the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Aqua_Ring">Aqua Ring</a>. Now leave that specific area, and go down the right side of the hall. Go down the stairs and through the now unlocked door.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_18" class="f_boss f_item">You'll see a gate at the far side of the screen, but don't go through that yet. Instead, head the other way. You'll come upon another gate; that's the one you need to go through. Just don't forget to pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Grenade_Shells">Grenade Shells</a> before leaving this room. Don't worry about the sharks; they can't do anything besides flop around. Don't waste your ammo, unless you just shoot one once to get some happiness. Keep running until you get down by <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Neptune">Neptune</a>. Climb up onto the platform. Try to grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Key_for_the_Gallery">Key For The Gallery</a> in the corner. It will drop into the water when <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Neptune">Neptune</a> wakes up. Don't shoot him. There is a green control panel that you can push into the water, then pull the lever near where the key was, to electrocute the shark.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_19" class="f_item">Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Key_for_the_Gallery">Key For The Gallery</a>, and go back to the room before this one and go through the other gate. After entering through the gate, there will be some <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Magnum_Rounds">Magnum Rounds</a> on a box. Pick them up, but do not use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Magnum_Rounds">Magnum Rounds</a> yet. Climb up the ladder and go though the door. You'll now be in the place where you had to push the boxes into water (<a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Aqua_Ring">Aqua Ring B1</a>). Climb back up to Room 002 and exit the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Aqua_Ring">Aqua Ring</a>.</li>

Be warned if you grab it you will be attacked by bees and poisoned.... And then poisoned again once you enter the gallery and get stung there too. Let's avoid that unnecessary double poisoning and just take care of it in the next section.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_21" class="f_item">Before continuing, you may need to make a pit stop to unload gear at the Save Room.. ecially if you didn't take the guide's advice and got stung and poisoned by the bees. Do that now (besides, you have some ammo to drop off, remember?). Then, with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Key_for_the_Gallery">Key For The Gallery</a> in hand, head back to the gallery door (door by room 002).</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_22" class="f_item"><a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dormitory/Gallery">Gallery Room</a>.

Go past room 003. Keep on going down the hallway. Take the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Insecticide_Spray">Insecticide Spray</a>, head to the outside hallway. To the right of room 002, there's the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Map_of_the_RESIDENCE">Map Of The Residence</a>.  After you take that there's a hole; don't look into it. Use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Insecticide_Spray">Insecticide Spray</a> in it. The bees will be gone when you return to the room. Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Herb">Red Herb</a> (Very Easy) down the hall past where you got the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Insecticide_Spray">Insecticide Spray</a>, then further down, grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Key_for_Room_003">Room 003 Key</a>. Go to the save room again. Make sure to have at least two inventory spaces open and bring the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Unprinted_Book">Red Book</a>. Run back to the Gallery room.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_23" class="f_item">Head to Room 003 and unlock the door and discard the key.  Once you're in room 003, there's a bookshelf in the back. Grab the only book you can and Replace it with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Unprinted_Book">Red Book</a>. Now, you have to rearrange the book order. It's pretty basic and easy, doesn't take long at all, or it shouldn't. The woman's feet should be at the bottom (left), and her hands at top (right). After that, a shelf will slide over and reveal a secret door. Don't go in quite yet.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_1_24" class="f_item">First, check out the other door in the gallery room (not the doubles). Now you must match the tick marks with the colors you wrote down earlier, which should then have numbers on the colored pool balls. Select the first eye. Correspond to the correct number by your earlier notes. Do the same with the other two eyes. For example, if I had zero ticks and it was green, I would press the eye with zero ticks and then press number 6. You'll get it. When you're done, go in the door. In this room, there will four <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Empty_Bottle_(RE1)">Empty Bottles</a>, but you only need 3 (unless going for 100% items). Also in this room are chemicals <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/UMB_No.3">UMB no.3</a> and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow-6">Yellow 6</a> in containers.

Upon coming out of the double doors, you'll see a shark flopping around on the inner ring of the upper level. Just above that shark is a single door hiding in plain sight.  Go through it and you'll see part of <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Plant_42">Plant 42</a>. Go up to them and use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/V-JOLT">V-Jolt</a> and the roots will shrivel up.

<li data-id="playthrough_1_31" class="f_boss f_item">Now go all the way back to room 003 and through the secret door. The <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Plant_42">Plant 42</a> will grab you, but <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Barry_Burton">Barry Burton</a> will save you (if you've done everything I've said). Grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Helmet_Key">Helmet Key</a> from the fireplace when the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Plant_42">Plant 42</a> dies. Exit the room, and head back into Room 003 if you're going for 100% items. Go into the bathroom and drain the tub to get a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a>. Now, go back to the save room. As soon as you exit the Gallery, you'll have a cut-scene with Wesker. Continue forward to the save room to drop off supplies and save as necessary. Bring the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Assault_Shotgun_(RE1)">Assault Shotgun</a>. Now, remember the place with the waterfall? There are two dogs near there that ate the birds or something, so kill them. Head back to the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Mansion">Mansion</a> now, but watch out for snakes along the way. This time around it's likely inevitable that you will be bit and poisoned.

<li data-id="playthrough_2_1" class="f_item">Once you get back to the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Mansion">Mansion</a>, a cut-scene will play, and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_%CE%B1">Hunters</a> will appear. One <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_%CE%B1">Hunter</a> comes after you when the scene's over.

Enter the dining room. There should be a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Gemstone">Blue Gemstone</a> on the left side of the table, which is the opposite side the grandfather clock is on. Now head back upstairs, through the dining room balcony and head towards the save room. There are two <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_%CE%B1">Hunters</a> up here on Normal/Hard.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_2" class="f_item">Before you go down the stairs to the save room, go slightly into the small corridor. Go into the one next to you. There'll be an eagle statue on the wall that moves. Turn off the lights. Then, grab the ammo and a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a> on the shelf by the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_Gemstone">Yellow Gemstone</a>. Now, push the dressers so that they are underneath the animal heads that hold the gems you must get. Be sure to hear a "chink" type sound so that the eagle stops moving, and hug the wall to one of the dressers, climb up and get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Gemstone">Red Gemstone</a>. Repeat the process for the other gem. Once you have both  gems, go into the save room. Keep all of the gems, and bring weapons and your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Helmet_Key">Helmet Key</a>. Start heading towards the "F" shaped hall (by the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Shotgun_(Resident_Evil)">Broken Shotgun</a> room), and a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_%CE%B1">Hunter</a> jumps through each window.  Now there's a door for you to enter. It's on the shorter hall of the "F". Once you're in the room, place the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Gemstone">Blue Gemstone</a> and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_Gemstone">Yellow Gemstone</a> into the tiger statue. You will get some <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Shotgun_Shells_(RE1)">Shotgun Shells</a> and the first <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/MO_Disk_(RE1)">MO Disk</a>.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_3" class="f_item">Now head back to the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Mansion">Mansion's</a> main room and go and unlock the door you haven't been to on the main floor.

<li data-id="playthrough_2_4" class="f_item">Now find the other door. There will be a single zombie roaming around here, pretty easy to avoid if you want to conserve your ammo. After that, grab the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herb</a>, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a> and the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Jewelry_Box_(RE1)">Jewelry Box</a>. There's also a<a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Herb">Blue Herb</a> planter in here.

Now, there's a slight puzzle. Kinda hard to explain without using pictures, but I can try anyway. There are five pieces. The third (meaning third down) piece should be put on the bottom right side. The top piece goes in the upper left corner (you'll have to rotate if needed for any pieces). The fourth piece (at the beginning, make sure to remember what order they were in) goes in between the others. The last goes on the right side that's open, and you can figure out the rest. Might take a minute though, sometimes it doesn't quite fit, but that is the right way.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_5" class="f_item">When you're done, you'll have a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Coin">Brooch</a>.

Unlock the door with the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Oswell_E._Spencer,_Earl_Spencer">Spencer Family Crest</a> on it using your <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Emblem_Key">Emblem Key</a>.  Once inside the small study. You must turn on the lamp on the desk, and pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Object">Metal Object</a> next to you. Leave the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Object">Metal Object</a> in an item box if you can (head into the East save room). You're going to fight <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yawn">Yawn</a> the snake for the second time. The <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Grenade_Launcher_(RE1)">Grenade Launcher</a> works very well, so that's recommended. Go back to the dining room balcony. Go through the first door this time. Now, go back to the room where you got the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Key">Armor Key</a>. Go all of the way down, all the way, and you'll come to a door. You'll use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Helmet_Key">Helmet Key</a> to unlock it. There will be a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Green Herb</a> (2 on Easy, but none on Hard). Now keep going and something will come to you.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_2_6" class="f_boss f_item">It's <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yawn">Yawn</a> the snake. Keep running and climb down the ladder.

Then, you just blast its tail until it dies. If you go up the ladder <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Yawn">Yawn</a> won't be able to hit you. You'll see the pattern you need to go in, and it's actually pretty easy to hit its head a few times. When it's dead, it'll knock the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Last_Book_Vol._2">Last Book Vol.2</a> off of the bookshelf. Pick it up, examine it, and get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Medal_of_Wolf">Medal Of Wolf</a>.</li>

There will be a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_%CE%B1">Hunter</a> near the save room door. Blast it, and there is another upstairs if you're playing on Normal/Hard. Then head up stairs, and turn left, and walk until you turn the corner. Keep going and enter the door. Pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a> if you need them, but keep in mind you'll need spaces open, at least 2. Go through the next door. Push the statue you see in the opening to the left. The walls will close in on you, but as long as the statue's there you'll be fine. Now go out to where the statue was. Keep going into the other passage. There will be a switch that you need to push at the end of the room to get the walls to come back. Push it, and run back to the other statue, and push it to the left (you'll see the indentation where it needs to go). After that's done, go in where it opened up. There's a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Gun">Stun Gun</a> (Easy, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger">Dagger</a> on Normal) on a cabinet. Go down.

<li data-id="playthrough_2_16" class="f_item">Now, you gotta travel all the way back to where the waterfall is. Watch out for dogs and snakes along the way. Don't worry if you get poisoned, there is a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Herb">Blue Herb</a> planter near the waterfall. Once you're there, head down and find the elevator, and place the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Battery_(RE1_remake)">Battery</a> in it and use it. You'll come back to a familiar area. Go and use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Square_Crank">Square Crank</a> to fill up the pool. Now go back and use the elevator to go down. Now the waterfall won't be there, and you can head down into the passage and down the ladder into the depths below.</li>

Watch the cut-scene, then get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hexagonal_Crank">Hexagonal Crank</a> from his body. There will be a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_%CE%B1">Hunter</a> when you head out. Run away or kill, you won't be coming back into this room. Now after the elevator room, the next room will have another <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_%CE%B1">Hunter</a> (2 on Normal/Hard). Now go back to where the item box is. You'll be fighting the biggest of the spiders soon, and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Incendiary_Shells">Incendiary Shells</a> work best. Now keep going and use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hexagonal_Crank">Hexagonal Crank</a> on the wall (you'll see where it goes). Head through the door.

<li data-id="playthrough_3_3" class="f_item">If you go where the boulder was, you'll get some <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Shotgun_Shells_(RE1)">Shotgun Shells</a>.

Now find and pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_Knife_(RE1)">Combat Knife</a>, and you must equip it and use it on the door covered with spider web across from the door you entered by. Now there will a boulder again. You must use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hexagonal_Crank">Hexagonal Crank</a> three times on the wall this time.

<li data-id="playthrough_3_4" class="f_item">If you keep going to where the boulder was, you'll find a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/First_Aid_Box">First Aid Kit</a>.

After you do, use the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Hexagonal_Crank">Hexagonal Crank</a> on the wall. The statue will be pushed out. Now push it onto the round platform and it will turn 90 degrees. Now you have to push it off, then back on again to get it facing the proper way. Move it off, then push it into the indentation, by the other statue. You'll get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Cylinder">Cylinder</a>.

Keep going and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa Trevor</a> appears in the direction you head first, so when you have the choice of which way, start going left but then go right.

<li data-id="playthrough_3_6" class="f_item">Right now, ignore it. Keep going until you see a door; go through it. Climb the pile of boxes in the corner for some nice things.

If you see <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa Trevor</a> coming, go the other way. Watch the cut-scene. Get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Object">Metal Object</a> from the item box and go down the ladder. There's also some ammo on Easy by the ladder. Now push the box into the crusher. After you crush it, jump down and get the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Flamethrower">Broken Flamethrower</a>. Go back to the place with <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor">Lisa Trevor</a>, and now it's time for you to use the switch.

<li data-id="playthrough_3_7" class="f_item">Watch out for snakes. After you come out of the water, pick up the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Jewelry_Box_(RE1)">Jewelry Box</a>.

<li data-id="playthrough_3_10" class="f_other">In the next area the graveyard where you got the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Colt_Python">Magnum</a>.

Now go to the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Mansion">Mansion's</a> main room. There's a set of double doors underneath the stairs.

<h3><font style="font-family:Georgia;">[ FAQ ]</font></h3>
<br>
<font color="red">~</font> The layout and framework of this guide was based on my <a href="https://adore33.github.io/White-Day-Checklist/">White Day - Checklist</a>.<br>
<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> The collective data and information was based on <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/JaredPetty-IGN">Jared Petty's</a> - <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/resident-evil/Walkthrough"> Resident Evil: HD Remaster Wiki Guide.</a>
I fixed a few spelling errors and re-worded a few things.  In general though it is a straight conversion from guide to checklist.
Any other information came from the <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Resident_Evil">Resident Evil Wiki.</a><p></p>

<font color="red">~</font> Again, this is <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/JaredPetty-IGN">Jared Petty's</a> work.
This is simply another form of the same information that I converted or added to for the purposes of the Checklist.
So any thanks you have please direct towards <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/JaredPetty-IGN">Jared Petty.</a>
I just find these Checklists nice to use.  I as well wanted to learn how to make and edit them.
I tried to stick close to <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/JaredPetty-IGN">Jared Petty's</a> Guide with this Checklist.  You can use either one or both together.
His includes picture references that are useful.<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> This Checklist is best viewed on a PC browser.
If using your phone, please rotate your phone to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jCU2aKJxxmAJzsQlrcG8gYMfLioAYnod/view?usp=sharing">Landscape Orientation</a> for best viewing.
My HTML code changes or additions were all done by hand in Notepad.
I tried my best to get the formatting and placement to look good on monitors and phones.<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> Any errors, typos, adjustments and improvements that need to be addressed in the Checklist.
You can drop me an email and I will look into it.
<a href="mailto:penumbra1979@comcast.net?subject=White_Day_Checklist_Modifications">Send Email.</a>

<h3><font style="font-family:Georgia;">[ Is This A Guide Or Walkthrough? ]</font></h3>
<br>
<font color="red">~</font> Not exactly.  This Checklist will help you obtain most <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Resident_Evil_items">Items</a> and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Resident_Evil_creatures">Boss</a> kills needed to beat the game.
Other <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Resident_Evil_items">Items</a> that are not listed you will obtain natrually as you progress and search.  Like <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Herb">Herbs</a>, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Handgun_Magazine">Handgun Magazines</a> and <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Resident_Evil_files">Files</a>.
So search rooms as you would without this Checklist.<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> This Checklist will lead you to the good ending and assumes you are playing on Normal difficulty.
If this is your first time playing <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/1/us/">Resident Evil: HD Remake</a>.  You may want to consider playing on "Easy" mode first to give you a feel for the game,
as some may find it very difficult.  Then with some familiarity and desire to 100% the game.
Go back through on "Normal" mode and use this Checklist to help.  You can still use this Checklist for "Easy" mode, just not everything will apply.
Here is a breakdown of the difficulty modes as they are not traditionally labeled...<P></P>

<font color="red">~ </font>Walking - Very Easy<BR>
<font color="red">~ </font>Hiking - Easy<BR>
<font color="red">~ </font>Mountain - Normal<BR>
<font color="red">~ </font>Hard - Unlocked<BR>
<font color="red">~ </font>Real Survival - Unlocked<BR>

<h3><font style="font-family:Georgia;">[ How To Use This Checklist ]</font></h3>

<font color="red">~</font>The best way is to use it as a reference for your first playthrough.  It can be easy to walk into a Boss encounter in some situations.  Before you leave an area make sure you didn't miss anything important for progression.
Reference it then so you don't ruin the game for yourself on your first playthrough.<P></P>
<font color="red">~</font> The sorting method for the Checklist may need some adjustments to be the most effective and efficient.
So please, as stated above, drop me an email if it can be improved.  It isn't designed for a speedrun or anything.
It is setup based on ( <font color="red">Areas > Buildings > Floors > Rooms </font> ) you have access to.
There is a certain degree of backtracking needed in Resident Evil regardless.<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> The three buttons you see on the ( <font color="red">Playthrough</font> ) page.
Clicking them so the Eye Symbol is crossed out will hide that category in the Checklist.
Helpful to simplify the Checklist if you only need one category visible.<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> The ( <font color="red">Other</font> ) category pertains to directions or explanations.  Usually not directly with obtaining an <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Resident_Evil_items">Item</a> or killing a <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Resident_Evil_creatures">Boss</a>.<p></p>
<font color="red">~</font> Use the Searchbar provided within the Checklist to search for keywords.
Such as <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Barry_Burton">Barry</a>, <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Key">Sword Key</a>, etc. to quickly filter the Checklist.<p></p>

<h3><font style="font-family:Georgia;">[ How Does The Checklist Status Get Saved? ]</font></h3>

<font color="red">~</font> The Checklist is saved to your browser on your PC or your phone's local history storage.
Be careful when clearing your browser's cache as it will reset your saved progress in the Checklist.

<h3><font style="font-family:Georgia;">[ How Can I Save For Multiple Characters? ]</font></h3>

<font color="red">~</font> Go to ( <font color="red">Options</font> ) tab at the top of this page.  In the ( <font color="red">Profile Management</font> ) section, Add or Edit profiles.

<h3><font style="font-family:Georgia;">[ How Can I Change The Background Color? ]</font></h3>

<font color="red">~</font> I set it to Black ( <font color="red">Darkly Theme</font> ) by default to be easier on the eyes and to go with the asthetic of this Checklist.
If you prefer to be blinded by white go to ( <font color="red">Options</font> ) tab at the top of this page.
In the ( <font color="red">Theme Selection</font> ) section, change it to ( <font color="red">Standard Theme</font> ) or pick any other theme you would like.
